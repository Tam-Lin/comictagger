	Makefile or script to 
		CX freeze
		other files
		NSIS
		
Toolbar icons

Page Browser

Multi-match dialog

Stand-alone CLI

TaggerWindow entry fields
	General layout
	Special Dialogs needed for:   
		Pages Info
	Color changing stuff need more work

GUI to handle mutliple files or folders
-----------		

Be more tolerant of mis-labled extensions i.e. cbr when it's a cbz

Form type validation Ints vs strings for month, year. etc

Check all HTTP responses for errors

Lots of error checking

Archive function to  detect tag blocks out of sync


Idea:  Support only CBI or CIX for any given file, and not both 
	   If user selects different one, warn about potential loss/re-arranging of data

Longer term:
	Think about mass tagging and (semi) automatic volume selection


Other settings possibilities:
	Last tag style
	Last "Open" folder (include dragged)
	Keep a history of queries somewhere??
	
Content Hashes!!

Image Hashes:
	Failures of average hash:
		Thor 600 Wrap-around w/ different aspect ratio
		Bone 3 - Variant Cover, 
		Avengers #1, #13, #81
		
		
Filename parsing:
	Concatenation of Name and Issue??
	"1602"


App option to covert RAR to ZIP

If no unrar in path, then filter out CBR/RAR from open dialog


Wizard for converting between tag styles


Remove stale data from cache DB 
SQLite chokes on "Batman\ Li'l Gotham 001.cbr" name


Auto search:
	Logging class
	Choosing with pub year
	Lexical analysis 
	Maybe remove "the" and leading "A" before searching and matching for closer
	Searching w/o issue #?
