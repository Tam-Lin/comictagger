Bugs
----------------
SERIOUS BUG: rebuilding zips!
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578443/trigger-io-errno-18-cross-device-link

Be more tolerant of mis-labled extensions i.e. cbr when it's a cbz

Form type validation Ints vs strings for month, year. etc

Check all HTTP responses for errors

Lots of error checking

Other settings possibilities:
	Last tag style
	Last "Open" folder (include dragged)
	Clear caches
	
	
Content Hashes!!

Image Hashes:
	Failures of average hash:
		Thor 600 Wrap-around w/ different aspect ratio
		Bone 3 - Variant Cover, 
		Avengers #1, #13, #81
		
		
Filename parsing:
	Concatenation of Name and Issue??
	"1602"

CV search - 	Maybe remove "the" and leading "A" before searching and matching for closer

	
App option to covert RAR to ZIP

If no unrar in path, then filter out CBR/RAR from open dialog

Wizard for converting between tag styles

Remove stale data from cache DB 

SQLite chokes on "Batman\ Li'l Gotham 001.cbr" name

Auto search:
	Choosing with pub year
	Lexical analysis 
	Searching w/o issue #?
	
-------------
Other
------------

Archive function to  detect tag blocks out of sync


Idea:  Support only CBI or CIX for any given file, and not both 
	   If user selects different one, warn about potential loss/re-arranging of data

Longer term:
	Think about mass tagging and (semi) automatic volume selection
