Use external RAR tools to generate rar with CIX!


Hourglass popup, or whatever, for when busy

Idea:  Support only CBI or CIX for any given file, and not both 
	   Determine style when opening file, and set that as current save style
	   If user selects different one, warn about potential loss/re-arranging of data

Longer term:
	Think about mass tagging and (semi) automatic volume selection
	
Maybe:  keep a history of tagged volumes IDs from CV, and present those first

Remember preferred style (and other stuff) (prolly kept in ~/.comictagger.conf, or some such)
