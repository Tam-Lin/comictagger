Bugs
----------------
SERIOUS BUG: rebuilding zips!
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578443/trigger-io-errno-18-cross-device-link

OSX:
	toolbar
	weird unrar complaints
	Page browser sizing
	Override cursor is not beachball
	
Filename parsing:
	Rework how series name is separated from issue

Test ComicRack android

Form type validation Ints vs strings for month, year. etc

Check all HTTP responses for errors

Lots of error checking

Future
------------
Add  warning message to allow writing CBI to RAR, and ask them to contact CBL ! :-)

Scrape alternate Covers from ComicVine issue pages

GCD scraper or DB reader

GUI to handle mutliple files or folders

Auto search:
	Searching w/o issue #?

Content Hashes!!

Wizard for converting between tag styles

App option to covert RAR to ZIP


Archive function to  detect tag blocks out of sync


Idea:  Support only CBI or CIX for any given file, and not both 
	   If user selects different one, warn about potential loss/re-arranging of data

Longer term:
	Think about mass tagging and (semi) automatic volume selection
